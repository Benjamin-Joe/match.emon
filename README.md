# Overview
I decided to create a matching game for project 2 with Code Institute. I creates this game focusing it around javascript. The concept of the game is very simple. Players must find all 10 pokemon character matches in the fewest moves possible. There are 20 playing cards in total so the best possible score is 20, although that is very unlikely :) <br> Given that moves are being counted as you play it encourages replayability as you have a chance at bettering your score.I believe that this website shows that I am able to use javascript, html and css together with a fairly good end result. <br> 
The thing I am most proud of with this website is it's mobile view, I believe that the website looks even better on mobile than on PC !
I created this website using three languages:  
[HTML5](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) | [CSS](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) | [Javascript](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript)

# The Build
The build was a challenge as I wasn't very confident with javascript and although the game is not without flaws i believe that it is pretty good for a novice such as myself. <br> I went in several different directions during the build process, so there are several fairly large changes from the initial idea to the final line. <br> To begin with I created a start button and used javascript to get it functional, I felt it was the best place to start

It took me a while to get used to writing javascript so I decided to take it very slow and try to log everything as I went along in the console just to keep me on track. I then created several tests as I went along for various aspects of the foundation of the project.  <br>
Tests I created along the way are as follows:  
Checking Images exist in the console

 # Wireframes
Creating wireframes is a very important step as is helps me to create a visual representation of where I am aiming to go. This allows me to stay focused on the task ahead and not get sidetracked on the smaller things.  

# Functionality
The functionality was by far the most difficult thing about this project. There was a lot of writing and re writing, but overall I am fairly pleased with how it turned out. The specific thing that I found most difficult was actually my own coding! It wasn't until I started bug fixing the game that I noticed I couldn't understand a lot of my own code! This was due to poor naming of functions. So with a little guidance from my mentor I was able to refactor the code and make it waaaaay more readable than it was. So it tought me a very important lesson.  ALWAYS WRITE CLEAR CODE :)  
 
# Styles
Choosing a style for the website proved tricky as i'm quite indecisive on a good day! But I ended up choosing a minimalist view because I didn't want to users to have a sensory overload upon arrival, also slightly due to time constraints.I think that choosing black for the navbar and white for the navbar text really stands out nicely. Also the hover effect creates a subtle enlargment of the links. On smaller screens (below 600px) the navbar will turn into a hamburger icon with the main title still in view, this looks quite sleek and provides good user experience for those on mobile devices. The contact page also stands out subtly with the border effect around the contact form.     
The overall look of the rest of the website looks fairly plain, but with just a tiny amount of color so it doesn't look dull. I will definitely tweak the look of the website as time goes on and I learn more about coding.
